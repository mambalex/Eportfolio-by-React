02/10/2018

After break we came back do our project.
Before break we finished analyze relation.
However we met some problem on front end connect to backend. The main issue is that how to get token from backend and store it in front end.
Finally, we decided use JSON Web Token(JWT) to solve this problem.
Next week Han Zhang and Yang Yang aim to finish all backend API, Zhiqin Zhang will continue work on connect to backend.
